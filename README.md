# Database-with-files
Heres the code that can store an employee's data to a file on the user's system and access it to read

This code has commands exclusive to Linux in the "mod" and "del" functions so they may not work on Windows. You can change the commands inside "system()" as per your OS. We can also integrate "mod" and "del" to be one function, I will do that if i get time. I will also add feature of searching by name rather than only ID. If you have a better implementation of this code you are welcome to tell me! Thanks and cheers!
